We can identify that a heap is being used because the code uses a priority_queue. In C++, priority_queue is implemented internally using a heap data structure, where elements are accessed based on priority rather than insertion order.

✅ How to identify Heap usage from the question statement (English)

Agar question me yeh keywords / conditions dikhen, to samajh jao heap / priority queue use hoga 👇

🔑 1. When the question says “Kth smallest / Kth largest”

Find the kth smallest element
Find the kth largest element

➡️ Heap is indicated, because we need repeated access to min or max element.

Identification statement:

Since the problem asks for the kth smallest/largest element, a heap is suitable because it allows efficient retrieval of minimum or maximum elements.

basic of heap mostly used with prority_queue
code:
using namespace std;
// function to find kth smallest
int kthSmallest(vector<int> &arr, int k)
{
priority_queue<int> pq; // max heap

    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++)
    {
        pq.push(arr[i]);

        // keep only k elements in heap
        if (pq.size() > k)
        {
            pq.pop();
        }
    }

    return pq.top(); // kth smallest

}
int main()
{
int n, k;
cin >> n >> k;
vector<int> arr(n);
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
cin >> arr[i];
}

    int result = kthSmallest(arr, k);
    cout << "Kth Smallest Element = " << result;

    return 0;

}

Heap Operations
Operation Time Complexity
push() O(log n)
pop() O(log n)
top() O(1)
Build heap (n inserts) O(n log n)
Build heap (heapify) O(n)
